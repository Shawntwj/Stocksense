This is a project to help learn about trading in the markets by setting up a simulation and testing your trading strategies to see if they work out in a simulated environment.

This environment is based on past data up to 10 years and includes top news (up to 3-5 headlines) and earning reports (every quarter) for that stock for you to backtest your strategy.
