This is a project to help learn about trading in the markets by setting up a simulation and testing your trading strategies to see if they work out in a simulated environment.

This environment is based on past data up to 10 years and includes top news (up to 3-5 headlines) and earning reports (every quarter) for that stock for you to backtest your strategy. 

In the future the web app will be containerized in the meantime to start up the frontend, ensure that node version >= 18.17 is installed

To start the frontend 

`npm run dev`

To start the backend 

`mvn spring-boot`
